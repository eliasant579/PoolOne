# PoolOne
To anyone testing: the default xml is now uploaded. If you want to test how to save a new score try to shoot in the game a couple of times
then press k: this triggers the same procedure triggered by the absence of target balls on the screen.

To reset the xml open the bin folder, debug, resources, highScores.xml and paste this in

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<highscores>
  <highscore>
    <name>TEST1</name>
    <shots>10000</shots>
    <dateTime>2019-06-16 10:59:54 PM</dateTime>
  </highscore>
  <highscore>
    <name>TEST2</name>
    <shots>1000</shots>
    <dateTime>2019-06-16 11:00:22 PM</dateTime>
  </highscore>
  <highscore>
    <name>TEST3</name>
    <shots>10000</shots>
    <dateTime>2010-11-13 10:33:54 AM</dateTime>
  </highscore>
</highscores>

I made the pockets ridiculously big on puropse: it is easier to sink balls in them and they are kind of funny to see
